# BallCollisionDetector
C#, Object-Oriented, Console Project


The primary goal was to practice good form.

This was a fun project that generates two balls and tells the user whether the two balls collided with each other or not, after the one moves into position.

Technically, it doesn't say whether they crossed each other, but just whether they touch each other at the end of the movement.

It would be better to pull the classes into separate files.
